# User-Defined Bridge Network - Easy Notes

- **User-Defined Bridge Network:**
  - Like making your own private WiFi for containers.
  - You control which containers join and talk to each other.

- **Why use it?**
  - Containers can talk to each other using their names (like 'container2'), not just IP addresses.
  - Makes things easier and more organized, especially with lots of containers.

- **How to create:**
  - `docker network create mynet` (makes a new network called 'mynet')

- **How to use:**
  - Start containers with `--network mynet` to put them on your network.

- **Test communication:**
  - Use `curl http://container2` from inside another container to check if they can talk.

- **Why is this better than default?**
  - More control, easier naming, better for teamwork and scaling.

- **Clean up:**
  - Remove containers and network when done to keep things tidy.
