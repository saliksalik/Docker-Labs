# Linking Containers - Easy Notes

- **Container Linking:**
  - Old way to connect containers using `--link`.
  - Lets one container find another by a nickname (alias).
  - Not recommended anymore—use networks instead!

- **User-Defined Networks:**
  - Like making your own private WiFi for containers.
  - Containers can talk to each other by name automatically.
  - Easier, safer, and better for teamwork.

- **Drawbacks of Linking:**
  - Only one-way communication.
  - Hard to scale and manage.
  - Deprecated (not for modern projects).

- **How to link (old way):**
  - `docker run --name myweb --link mydb:mysql -d httpd`

- **How to use networks (better way):**
  - `docker network create mynetwork`
  - Start containers with `--network mynetwork`.

- **Summary:**
  - Use user-defined networks for real projects. Linking is just for learning or old setups.
